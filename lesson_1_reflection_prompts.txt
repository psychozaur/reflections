How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?


    It sticks out visually when erased is red and added is green, so yeah, helpful. Also, it seems very useful to pinpoint the exact differences between large files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?


    Maybe it would allow me to see the mistakes I make.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


    The con is that you have to micromanage the manual choice but the pro of a manual choice is saving what is relevant.
    Autosave often won't cut the size of a commit just right, so with some skill acquired I could be making easy judgments when commiting manually.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
 files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Sometimes you need to make a few small changes in multiple files to update the program.
    The choice for Git grants bigger flexibility depending on the character of the task. Changes like renaming the main character in several chapters of a novel or multiple filters, strokes applied to a single photo could have been monitored in Git because it's so versatile.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


    Git log: allows me to see the entire history along with the quantity of insertions and deletions
    Git diff: allows me to compare commits and see specific insertions and deletions or in other words what exactly changed between commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?


    Man, I'm fairly confident that with git log and git diff and git checkout I can't break anything and revert any bugs :) Gotta watch out for that detached HEAD though


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?


    Continuing with my Python Udacity course, I guess...
