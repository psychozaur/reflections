When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It's most convenient when you're cooperating with other people on a larger project. 
    I believe it's also okay to use it on text files like mentioned "choose-your-own-adventure".
    However, when working alone on some multi-file project maybe writing code in one's favorite IDE
    and then commiting locally is more convenient.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    First reason I can think of is to not to pull branches started on remote that are buggy or undesirable in any other fashion.
    Secondly, there might have been some merging done locally that prevents you from pulling a branch from remote
    which doesn't exist locally anymore.
