What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git folder is created upon initialization. It contains all the history of the changes?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?


The staging area is an intermediary state where files aren't commited yet as they are in a working directory or a repository? It seems to add complexity... For now, I can only see the value in choosing how many files to put in a staging area at once.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can always add or remove changes from the staging area to make sure your commit isn't too large. Git diff command allows to easily monitor changes saved in working directory, staging area and commits. Just don't forget to use 'git checkout master'. It's useful somehow.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?


Branches definitely help exploring new, experimental functionalities without the risk of making irreversible changes. The naming system also helps organizing those extra options you'd like to explore.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
